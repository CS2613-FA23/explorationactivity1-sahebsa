1. Which package/library did you select?
ans. the package i used is regex(regular expression)

2. What is the package/library?
ans. Python has a built-in package called re, which can be used to work with Regular Expressions.

What purpose does it serve?
ans. We needed regular expressions to implement tokenizer. A simple tokenizer that uses case folding.

How do you use it?
Used it for  trimming leading non-alphanumeric chars and trimming trailing non-alphanumeric chars

3. What are the functionalities of the package/library?
ans. re.search = Returns a Match object if there is a match anywhere in the string
re.sub = Replaces one or many matches with a string
re.split = Returns a list where the string has been split at each match

4. When was it created?
ans. regex package was releazed on Feb 16 2013.

5. Why did you select this package/library?
ans. Regex identifies sequence of characters that specifies a match pattern in text.
Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.
Regular expression techniques are developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.
As the creation of chatgpt has inspired me, regex was required to implement corpus based chatbot

6. How did learning the package/library influence your learning of the language?
ans. -Learning regex required a good understanding of Python's string handling, control structures, and functions.
It pushed me to delve into the details of string manipulation and regular expressions, helping me understand Python's capabilities better.
Regex provided me with a powerful tool to solve a variety of text manipulation problems.
This forced me to think critically and creatively, honing my problem-solving abilities not just in regex but also in Python as I integrated regex solutions into my Python code.

7. How was your overall experience with the package/library?
ans. My experience of learning the regex library in Python was highly valuable and impactful.
At the beginning, grasping the syntax and various components of regular expressions presented a steep learning curve.
However, with dedicated effort and practice, I was able to comprehend the fundamental building blocks.Learning regex significantly improved my string handling skills in Python.
I gained a deeper understanding of how to manipulate and process strings efficiently using regular expressions, which is a valuable skill for various data processing tasks.

8. When would you recommend this package/library to someone?
ans. If someone wants to work in data processing tasks or programs that involve string manipulation, I would recommend him/her to use regex

9. Would you continue using this package/library? Why or why not?
ans. Yes! Applying regular expressions to real-world projects, whether it was for data validation, text extraction, or parsing, will allow me to see the immediate impact and usefulness of regex in practical real world applications.
